Hi! I'm experiencing several critical logic issues in my SlotKing app. Please help fix the following:

---

üß± 1. Grid UI Bug for Multi-Hour Blocks  
- When I select a multi-hour slot (e.g., 9 PM - 12 AM), the vertical white lines still appear between each hour.  
- I want the selected grid to appear as **one solid block** without any inner borders, especially when selecting 2+ hours across the same day.  
- Please remove these inner lines visually to reflect a single time block.

---

üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 2. Calendar Deletion Logic Broken  
- I selected Mon/Tue/Wed blocks (see Screenshot 1), then deleted Tue/Wed (Screenshot 2).  
- The blocks **disappear from the calendar view**, but **still remain in the Available Time Slots section below**.  
- This means `Meeting Summary` is not syncing properly with the actual selection state.  
- Please make sure when a time block is deleted from the calendar, it also disappears from the summary below.

üëë 3. Crown Icon Size & Visibility Issue  
- The small crown icon in the upper-right corner of each Available Slot is still too small to see clearly.  
- Please increase its size and padding.  
- Additionally, there should be **no crowns** visible at this stage.  
  - Crowns should only appear **after users have voted**, not when the host creates time slots.

‚ôªÔ∏è 4. Residual Slot Ghosts After Deletion  
- I deleted previous slots (e.g., Tue 10 PM and Wed 11 PM), and then created new 3-hour blocks.  
- Instead of one 3-hour block, **two blocks appeared** ‚Äî one was the newly selected block, and the other seems to be a ghost leftover from previous deletion.  
- It seems like deleted timeSlots are not fully purged from memory/state.  
- Please fix the logic so that deleted blocks do not reappear in any form.

‚úÖ Bonus: Add "Reset" Button  
- Please add a `Reset All` button somewhere below the calendar that **completely removes all time slots** and resets the view to a clean state.

Let me know if you need help reproducing these bugs again ‚Äî I have screenshots of each step.
Thanks!
