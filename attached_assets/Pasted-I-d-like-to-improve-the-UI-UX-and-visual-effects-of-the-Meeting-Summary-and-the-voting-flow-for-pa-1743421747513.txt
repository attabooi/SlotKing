I'd like to improve the UI/UX and visual effects of the "Meeting Summary" and the voting flow for participants.

Here’s what needs to be done:

---

🎨 1. [Improve Visual Design of the Summary Section]

- The current summary time slots (e.g. "Wed 2 PM - 6 PM", etc.) are displayed in a horizontal list, which becomes hard to read.
- Please change the layout to a **multi-line stacked list** or **grid-style display** for better readability.
- Each group should show:
  - Day (e.g. "Wed") and time (e.g. "2 PM - 6 PM") with larger font
  - Use different **text colors per weekday** for fast visual separation
  - Add slight card background with soft shadow or border to each time group
  - Include a small trash icon for each to allow removal

🚀 2. [Add Host "Confirm" Button + Transition to Voting Phase]

- Add a `Confirm Schedule` button for the host.
- When clicked:
  - Lock in the host's selected time slots.
  - Transition the UI into **voting mode**.
  - The confirmed time slots should have **highlighted animation** (e.g. soft bounce or pulsing glow).
  - Show a `copyable link` to share with participants.

🎉 3. [Voting UX for Participants]

- When participants visit the link, they should see only the **confirmed slots**.
- When they click a time slot to vote:
  - Add a **confetti (firework) effect** (like Party.js or custom animation)
  - Show a small participant icon in the top-left corner of the selected time group
  - If multiple people select the same slot, show stacked participant icons (with overlap)
  - If too many (>10), summarize with "+N"

🔁 4. [Reset All Button for Host]

- Add a `Reset All` button (visible only to the host)
- When clicked:
  - Remove all selected slots and clear participant data
  - Show a confirmation modal before wiping

The goal is to make the experience more delightful and gamified — like selecting a team in a strategy game. Focus on rhythm, feedback, and elegant microinteractions.
