Hi! I need help fixing some serious state sync issues in my SlotKing project. Please read carefully.

---

🧩 What's Wrong (Step-by-Step Reproduction):

1. I enter a meeting title and user name.
2. I create 1-hour slots on:
   - Monday
   - Tuesday
   - Wednesday
3. Then, I delete the Tuesday and Wednesday slots by clicking the trash icon.
   - ✅ The time blocks disappear from the calendar view.
   - ❌ But they are still shown in the "Available Time Slots" section under the meeting summary.
4. After this, ghost participants suddenly appear (even though I'm the only user).
   - These participants were never created or added.
   - This seems to happen especially after adding/deleting slots multiple times.

---

💡 Observations:

- It looks like the frontend and state store (maybe global state or backend data) are **not synced properly** after deletion.
- The “Available Time Slots” UI might be reading from outdated data or not responding to deletion actions correctly.
- This might also be tied to a localStorage/session or stale memory state.

---

⚠️ Additional UI Issue:

- When I drag to create a time slot, the visual block now has a **visible line between hours**, making it look like multiple blocks.
- Please make sure the dragged block appears as **one seamless square** (no horizontal dividers inside the grid).

📁 Files to Check (Assuming folder structure):
- `client/components/TimeGrid.tsx` — handles calendar drag/select
- `client/components/Summary.tsx` — displays Available Time Slots
- Any global state logic (Zustand, Redux, context, etc.)
- Ensure state updates and deletions are properly reflected across both calendar + summary UI.

---

✅ What I Need Fixed:
1. Ensure when a time slot is deleted from the calendar, it also disappears from the Available Time Slots section.
2. Fix the ghost participants bug — only actual user interactions (votes/selections) should appear.
3. Remove the visual border lines in dragged time slot blocks (should look like one box).
4. Do a quick audit on the state sync flow between calendar and summary section.

Thanks!
