Hi! I need help fixing some state-related and UI logic issues in my Replit project “SlotKing.” Here’s what’s wrong, and how my project is structured:

---

🧩 Project Structure:
- Frontend: `client/`
- Backend/API: `server/`
- Shared logic: `shared/`
- Using TypeScript + Tailwind + likely React/Vite-based stack
- See main config files:
  - `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`

---

🛠️ Current Bugs and Needed Fixes:

1. 🧍 Participant Count Bug:
   - I'm setting my user name as "안녕", and I’m the only user.
   - But when I drag new time blocks, the number of participants keeps increasing falsely.
   - ⚠️ Please check how the user identity is stored and referenced in `client/`, especially in the grid creation logic.
   - Fix so that **only real user interactions (voting/clicking)** count as new participants.

2. 🗑️ Trash Icon Not Working:
   - The trash can icon on the time grid should delete that grid group.
   - Currently it does nothing.
   - Please check the component that renders each grid and ensure the delete handler is properly connected.

3. ♻️ Reset Button Missing:
   - I need a global “Reset” button that **clears all created time slots and resets the state completely**.
   - Even after manually deleting all, sometimes **old slots come back** after I create a new one — state is not fully cleared.

4. 👑 Crown Icon Too Small:
   - The crown icon is shown for the top-ranked time slot but it’s way too small and barely visible.
   - Please increase the size and slightly overlap the top of the slot card for emphasis.

5. 👻 Ghost Participants Appear:
   - After dragging multiple slots, the Available Time Slots section shows participant avatars that don’t exist.
   - These are not real users.
   - Please ensure only real voting users (with distinct names or sessions) are added to the participants list.

6. 🗂️ State Isolation Issue:
   - Time slots on different days are being merged into one group.
   - ⚠️ Each day’s time slots should be isolated — a drag from Tue 6PM to Wed 8PM should not be one group.

📁 Suggested Files to Check:
- `client/components/TimeGrid.tsx` (or similar) — for drag/select/delete logic
- `client/state/` or wherever global state is handled — confirm reset and deletion actually clears store
- `client/components/Summary.tsx` — where Available Time Slots and participants list is rendered
- Any localStorage/sessionStorage logic — make sure deleted blocks don't persist or rehydrate unexpectedly
