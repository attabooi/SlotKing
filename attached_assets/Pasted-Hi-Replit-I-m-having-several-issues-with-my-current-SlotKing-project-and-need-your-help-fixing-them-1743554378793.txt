Hi Replit, I'm having several issues with my current SlotKing project and need your help fixing them. Here's a clear list of what's wrong with both the UI and the logic:

---

🧩 Issue Summary (based on screenshots):

1. 🧱 Multi-Hour Block UI Bug
   - When I drag to select 2–3 hours in the calendar grid, the blocks are visually separated by thin white horizontal lines.
   - These blocks should visually appear as one single block, without inner borders between the hours.
   - Please update the CSS so multi-hour selected slots appear as a single seamless rectangle.

---

2. 👻 Ghost Participants Appearing
   - I am the only participant (name: `123123`), and I haven't invited or simulated any others.
   - After selecting time blocks on different days (like Mon 9-12, Tue 10-12), random participant avatars appear in the Available Time Slots section (e.g., green `J`, blue `S`, pink `M` etc).
   - These ghost participants should NOT exist. The list should only update when real users interact with the voting page.

---

3. 🗑️ Deletion Not Syncing Properly
   - When I delete a block from the calendar view (using the trash icon), the block disappears visually...
   - BUT the corresponding block in the “Available Time Slots” summary section below is not removed.
   - Also, sometimes deleted blocks reappear unexpectedly in future selections — seems like old state/cached state is persisting.
   - Please fix the state synchronization so deletion applies across both calendar and summary, and ensure old state doesn’t come back.

---

4. 🔁 Reset Button Missing
   - I need a “Reset” button that clears all time slots and resets the meeting to the initial state.
   - This will allow hosts to quickly start over without refreshing the whole page.

---

5. 👑 Crown Icon Logic + Size
   - Right now, the crown icon is too small to notice.
   - Also, it’s showing up as soon as I create the time block, but that’s incorrect.
   - The crown should only appear on the most voted time slot (1st place) after real participants have submitted votes — NOT during the initial host setup.

---

6. 🧠 Caching Bug / Previous Data Leak
   - After I delete all time blocks, and drag new ones again, sometimes the previous deleted state reappears.
   - For example, if I had a deleted block from Tue 10 PM–12 AM, and I drag a new block starting from 10 PM, it brings back the old split state.
   - Please ensure that all state is reset properly and new selections are clean.

🛠️ Context:
- This is a scheduling app with time slot ranking and voting features.
- Codebase uses React, Tailwind, and shared schemas from `@shared/schema`.
- I'm using Replit Teams Pro with GitHub connected.

Let me know if you'd like to see exact component files or data structures. I'm happy to send references or video demos if needed.

Thanks so much!
