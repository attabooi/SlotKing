# WebSocket Removal Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to remove WebSocket functionality from the SlotKing application.

## Changes Made

1. **Client-side changes:**
   - Removed WebSocket connection code from `client/src/pages/Vote.tsx`
   - Deleted the `client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.tsx` hook file
   - Removed real-time update logic for vote updates

2. **Server-side changes:**
   - Modified `server/routes.ts` to:
     - Remove WebSocket server setup
     - Replace `broadcastUpdate` function with a no-op function
     - Keep API endpoints intact without real-time updates

3. **Dependency changes:**
   - Removed `ws` package from dependencies in `package.json`
   - Removed `@types/ws` from devDependencies in `package.json`

## Impact

The application now functions without real-time updates. Users will need to refresh the page manually to see updates to votes or other changes made by other users.

Key features like voting and meeting creation still work, but without the real-time collaborative aspect.

## Next Steps

To maintain a good user experience without real-time updates:

1. Consider adding a refresh button on relevant pages
2. Update UI to indicate that data may not be current
3. Implement polling on critical pages if needed (e.g., periodic API calls every 30-60 seconds)
